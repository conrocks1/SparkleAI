# SparkleAI
Artificial inteligence for human talk like Cortana or Siri. This is still very on in Alpha so don't expect a lot from this program.  

Simply run the "spark.py" file to start. There will be updates soon (not decided).

To test the mods in the file, type in "debug or "debug mode".

Unfortunetly, that's all the documentation I can give at the moment.
